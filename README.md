# SciFi UI Project

# Description of the assignment

We are tasked to do an UI using Java and Processing. UI must be interactive. My program represents Iron Man's helmet's UI, which is ibviously unfinished.

# Instructions

Hover over the circle at the center of the screen and it will expand. If mouse is clicked, the circle will change colour, representing the use of energy thus going to a higher grade of colour. 

# How it works

My program uses the processing libraries to work. The circle at the center of the screen expands by the use of the map function. I used an if statement to limit its reaction to the mouse movement. 

The change of colour is a simple update method implemented which changes the value of the hue if mouse is clicked.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

Making this a little interactive is what I'm most proud of, but I am dissappointed at me over all since I'm nowhere near done.
